I have created a simple template for Discord.py using object-oriented programming. I hope it will be helpful!

Programming large Discord bots with discord.py can be complex without using OOP. To simplify the process, 
I've created a straightforward template that encourages starting with OOP. This approach leads to more organized and efficient code, 
allowing you to confidently handle extensive projects. Explore the template and embark on your journey to create incredible bots for your Discord community!

<br/>nThe code is small and open source, and I would be delighted if anyone wanted to expand it or contribute to creating a better version. Your contributions are warmly welcome, and together, we can make it even more remarkable!
